Hello Class!

**************************** program comments *************************

1) To comment out a block of text start with  /*  and finish with  */ /*

2) The double slash, //, is a way to comment out to end of line.

3) In Java, the name of the class is also the name of the file. So the class
   name here is prog01 and the file name is prog01.java. 

4) Each program must have a "main" function. Execution always begins
   with the first line of main.   

5) The body of a class and function begins with "{" and ends with "}"

6) We rely on prewritten routines to display information to the screen.
   System.out.println is used to do this.  The string "Hello Class!" is 
   displayed on the screen.

7) Semicolons are used as statement terminators in Java.  

PRINTING YOUR SOURCE CODE

8) If your printed page comes out with a border, headers and footers
   you can remove them. Before you click on File->Print..., make sure
   the edit window is the active window.  Then select Print, then select
   "Print Options" on the bottom. Screen opens up to allow you to 
   uncheck those options.  Please do this.  */
