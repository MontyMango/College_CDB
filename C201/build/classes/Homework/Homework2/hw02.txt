Write a program (hw2.java) that merges the numbers in two files (input1.txt, input2.txt)
and writes all the numbers into a third file (output.txt).
Each input file contains a list of unsorted integer numbers.
We do not know how many numbers are in these files.
The output file should contain all numbers in ascending Homework.Lab5.order.
That means your data should be merged and sorted.

Hints: you should
(1) count the total numbers in these two files;
(2) create an array;
(3) read data from two files into the array;
(4) sort the array;
(5) write data in the array to a new file.
 
 
The two input files are input1.txt and input2.txt,
the output file should look similar to output.txt.
